\section{Parallel Computing}

\subsection{Parallel Computing Models}

Two types of parallel computers: direct connection machines and shared memory machines.

\subsubsection*{Direct connection machines}

Processors connected to neighbors.

\subsubsection*{Shared memory machines}

Different models:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exclusive Read, Exclusive Write (EREW): No two processors can read from or write to the same location at the same time.
    \item Concurrent Read, Exclusive Write (CREW)
    \item Concurrent Read, Concurrent Write (CRCW)\\
        Need some kind of rule for concurrent writes, one of the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All processors must write same value to location
            \item May write different values but only one is actually written.
                Which value to write could be chosen in one of the following ways:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Random
                    \item Arbitrary (machine can choose anything, not the same as random)
                    \item Priority
                \end{itemize}
            \item May write many values and all are written in some order. Again, need rule to determine order (random, arbitrary, or priority)
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Parallel Algorithms}

Define $T_P(N)$ to be the time for $P$ processors to solve problem of size $N$

\textbf{Speedup} ($S_P(N)$): Sequential time divided by parallel time $\displaystyle \paren{\frac{T_1(N)}{T_P(N)}}$

\textbf{Efficiency} ($E_P(N)$): Speedup divided by number of processors $\displaystyle \paren{\frac{S_P(N)}{P} = \frac{T_1(N)}{PT_P(N)}}$

An algorithm is \textbf{efficient} if $E_P(N) = \Theta(1)$

Lemma: $T_P(N) \leq T_1(N) \leq PT_P(N)$

Corollary: $1 \leq S_P(N) \leq P$

Corollary: $\displaystyle \frac 1 P \leq E_P(N) \leq 1$

General phenomenon: When $N = P$ the parallel algorithm is fast but inefficient, but when $N >> P$ the parallel algorithm is fast and efficient.

\subsubsection*{Summing}

Video has a way to make the parallel algorithm efficient about 3 minutes before video ends.
