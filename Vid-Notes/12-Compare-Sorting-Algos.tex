\section{Comparison of Sorting Algorithms}

\subsection*{Temporal and Spatial Locality}

\textbf{Temporal locality:} When you access something several times within a relatively short time.

\textbf{Spatial locality:} When you have access things that are close together (e.g. processing an array requires accessing a bunch of data that's close together).

\subsection*{Why quicksort is preferred}

Heap sort does not have good spatial locality, unlike bubblesort, insertion sort, selection sort, mergesort, and quicksort.

Mergesort isn't really in-place (can be done, but very hard to implement).
