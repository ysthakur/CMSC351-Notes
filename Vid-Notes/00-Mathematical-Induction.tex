\section{Mathematical Induction}

\subsection*{Constructive Induction}

Mathematical induction is very powerful in proving results but very weak in deriving results.

With constructive induction, if you know or guess the form of an answer, you can sometimes derive the actual answer while doing mathematical induction to prove it.

Before base case, make a guess with some coefficients that haven't been fixed yet. The base case will help constrain them a bit. Then in the inductive step, you solve for them.
