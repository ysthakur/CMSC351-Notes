\section{Bubble Sort}

Type of "selection sort" algorithm (not to be confused with \emph{the} Selection Sort algorithm)

Pseudocode:
\begin{verbatim}
for i = n downto 2:
  for j = 1 to i - 1:
    if A[j] > A[j + 1]:    # Comparison
      swap(A[j], A[j + 1]) # Exchange
\end{verbatim}

Number of comparisons: $\displaystyle \sum_{i=2}^n\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \binom{n}{2}$

Number of exchanges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Best case: If already sorted, then no exchanges will happen
    \item Worst case: If already sorted in reverse, then exchange will always happen, so same as number of comparisons: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
    \item Average case: Each permutation is equally likely.\\
    Need to count number of \textbf{inversions} (aka \textbf{transpositions}), which is a pair of elements out of order\\
    Number of inversions is same as number of exchanges\\
    Number of inversions is just half the number of pairs, which is $\displaystyle \frac 1 2 \binom n 2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{4}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Modified Bubble Sort}

Keep track of where last swap was made in last iteration, and you won't have to go beyond that next iteration.

\begin{verbatim}
i = n - 1
while i > 0:
  t = 1
  for j = 1 to i:
    if A[j] > A[j + 1]:
      swap(A[j], A[j + 1])
      t = j
  i = t - 1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Cocktail Shaker Sort}

Instead of going left to right and starting back at the left again, it goes left to right, then right to left, then left to right, like it's being shaken.
