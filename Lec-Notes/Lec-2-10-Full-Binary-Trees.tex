\section{Full Binary Trees}

\textbf{Definition:} In a full binary tree, every node has 0 or 2 children.

\textbf{Definition:} An \textbf{internal node} is a non-leaf node (a node that has one or more children).

\textbf{Theorem:} The number of internal nodes in a full binary tree is 1 more than the number of leaves.

\textbf{Definition:} \textbf{External path length} is the sum of the distances to the leaves.

\textbf{Definition:} \textbf{Internal path length} is the sum of the distances to the internal nodes.

$E = I + 2n$, where $n$ is the number of internal nodes, $E$ is external path length, and $I$ is internal path length.

$E = N + I - 1$
