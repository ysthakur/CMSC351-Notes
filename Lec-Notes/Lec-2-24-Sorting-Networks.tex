\section{Sorting networks}

You can sort in parallel. Need non-adaptive or oblivious algorithms. Mergesort can be done in parallel

Unlike adaptive algorithms, \text{oblivious} sorting algorithms always compare the same elements regardless of the data they get. Since mergesort and quicksort change depending on the data, not oblivious.
