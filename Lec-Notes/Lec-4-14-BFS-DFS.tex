\section{Breadth-First and Depth-First Search}

\subsection{Breadth-First Search}

Search all the nodes adjacent to current node, then search all nodes adjacent to all of those, and so on (with a tree, search level by level).

Uses a queue.

BFS takes $\Theta(m + n)$, where $n$ is number of vertices and $m$ number of edges.

\subsection{Depth-First Search}

For each node adjacent to current node, search it and then search the nodes adjacent to it (drill down).

Uses a stack.

Also takes $\Theta(m + n)$.
