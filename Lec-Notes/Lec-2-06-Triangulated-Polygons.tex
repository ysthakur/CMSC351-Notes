\section{Triangulated Polygons}

A triangulated polygon is either

\begin{itemize}
    \item A polygon with three sides
    \item A polygon with more than three sides with a straight line between two corners not next to each other forming two polygons sharing that new line such that each new polygon is triangulated
\end{itemize}

Structural induction proofs are inherently strong induction proofs.

\subsubsection*{Proof by structural induction}

\textbf{Theorem:} A triangular polygon with $n$ sides can be 3-colored.

\textbf{Base case:} Triangle

\textbf{Inductive Step:} Consider a triangulated polygon with $n$ sides\\
Since it's triangulated, it can be split into two triangulated polygons with fewer sides.\\
By the inductive hypothesis, both sides are 3-colorable, so color them.\\
