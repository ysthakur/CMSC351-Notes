\section{n-coins problem}

\textbf{Lemma:} Assuming we can solve the $n$-coins problem in $k$ weighings, then we can solve the $3n$-coins problem in $k+1$ weighings.

\textbf{Lemma:} Assuming that we can solve the nonadaptive (or oblivious) $n$-coins problem in $k$ weighings, we can solve the nonadaptive/oblivious $3n$-coins problem in $k+1$ weighings.

\textbf{Lemma:} Assuming that we can solve the nonadaptive/oblivious $n$-coins problem in $k$ weighings, where no coin is on one scale the entire time, then we can solve the nonadaptive/oblivious $(3n+3)$-coins problem in $k+1$ weighings, where no coin is one scale the entire time.
